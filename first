Students at Collage often complain about mess food but no one tracks the data properly. This project analyzes mess feedback to find patterns and suggest improvements.

 🎯 What This Project Does
- Collects feedback data from students (ratings + comments)
- Analyzes food quality trends across different hostels
- Predicts which food items get better ratings
- Uses AI to summarize feedback

 📊 Sample Data
I collected feedback from 15 students across 3 hostels:
- Hostel A: 5 responses
- Hostel B: 5 responses  
- Hostel C: 5 responses

 🔧 How I Built It
1. Created Google Form for feedback collection
2. Used Python (Pandas) to clean and analyze data
3. Made charts to visualize trends
4. Built ML model to predict ratings
5. Used prompt engineering to summarize comments

 📈 Key Findings
- Biryani gets 4.2/5 rating (most popular)
- Mess C needs improvement in cleanliness (2.8/5)
- Students want more breakfast variety

 🚀 How to Run This Project
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Run `python analyze.py`
4. Check `output/` folder for results

 📝 What I Learned
- Real data is messy (had to clean a lot)
- ML models need more data to be accurate
- Prompt engineering helps summarize text quickly
